# Node.js & MySQL
Overview

This activity is to create an Amazon-like storefront with **MySQL and Node.js**. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app is to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
